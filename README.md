# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Simple-RNN
This project shows the simple RNN used to do text classification of movie review's given by IMDB and using streamlit to display and then deploy it on Streamlit Cloud. 

In this Project, we have download the datasets from the tensorflow and build the RNN model. Here are the steps taken to execute this project : 
1. Creating the Gituhb repo and clone the repo on VS code on my local system.
   
2. Creating an virtual environment with [ python -m venv .venv ] and activate the environment by source  activate/bin/.venv. Downloading libraries like ipykernel, tensorlfow, keras etc in the requirements.txt file and installing all the libraries through pip install -r requirements.txt .
